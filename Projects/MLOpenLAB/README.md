# 🛠️ Data Processing, Modeling, and Interaction Tool 📊

I’m excited to share my latest project—a comprehensive **Data Processing, Modeling, and Interaction Tool** designed to make working with data simpler and more intuitive! Built using Python’s Tkinter library, this tool allows users to load, preprocess, visualize, and model data with ease, all through a user-friendly interface.

### Project Overview:
The tool offers a seamless experience for anyone working with data. From loading CSV files to visualizing data and building machine learning models, this project combines the power of Python’s data science libraries with an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). Here’s what it includes:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing** 🧹  
2. **Data Visualization** 📈  
3. **Model Selection, Training, and Evaluation** 🏆  
4. **Personalized Interaction** 💬 (Thanks to the Ollama API)

This project was inspired by my passion for simplifying machine learning workflows and my experiences during the **DNN Bootcamp** held at **GIK** in the summer of 2024.
