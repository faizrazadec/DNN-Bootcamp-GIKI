- **Make Predictions** 🔮
- **Evaluate Models** 📉
- **Collaborative Opportunities** 🤝

## Project Overview

In this project, we developed a **Data Processing, Modeling, and Interaction Tool** using Python's Tkinter library. The tool provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to perform a variety of data processing, modeling, and visualization tasks. Here's a breakdown of what we implemented:

### Key Components

1. **GUI Creation with Tkinter** 🖼️
   - We built a Tkinter-based application that serves as the main interface for interacting with the tool. The GUI includes various panels and widgets to facilitate user interactions.

2. **Data Loading** 📂
   - Users can load CSV files into the application. The data is displayed in the text widget for initial inspection.

3. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹
   - **Fill Null Values**: We implemented functionality to fill missing values in the dataset. Numerical features are filled with their mean, while categorical features are filled with their mode.
   - **Encode Categorical Features**: Categorical data is transformed into numerical format using `LabelEncoder` to make it suitable for machine learning algorithms.
   - **Scaling**: Data scaling options include Standard Scaler, Min-Max Scaler, and Robust Scaler to normalize the data.

4. **Data Visualization** 📈
   - We provided options to create various types of plots, including Line Plots, Scatter Plots, Box Plots, Histograms, and more. Users can select the X and Y variables and the type of plot to visualize their data.

5. **Model Selection and Training** 🏆
   - Users can select from a range of machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM) to train on their dataset. The tool handles the training process and updates the GUI with training results.

6. **Prediction** 🔮
   - After training a model, users can make predictions using the trained model. The predictions are displayed in the text widget.

7. **Model Evaluation** 📉
   - The tool evaluates the performance of the trained model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R2 Score. The evaluation results are shown in the text widget.

8. **User Interaction** 🤝
   - The tool includes an interactive feature where users can input their name and receive a personalized message generated using the Ollama API. This adds a touch of customization and engagement to the application.

### How It Works

1. **Loading Data**:
   - The user selects a CSV file, which is read into a pandas DataFrame. The DataFrame is displayed in the text widget, and the dropdowns for target variables and visualization options are populated.

2. **Processing Data**:
   - Users can fill missing values, encode categorical features, and scale the data as needed. These operations update the DataFrame and display results in the text widget.

3. **Visualizing Data**:
   - The user selects visualization options and generates plots using Matplotlib. The plots help in understanding data distribution and relationships between variables.

4. **Training and Predicting**:
   - The user selects a machine learning model and trains it on the preprocessed data. Predictions are made on the test set, and the results are displayed.

5. **Evaluating Models**:
   - After making predictions, the user can evaluate the model’s performance using selected metrics. Evaluation results provide insights into the model’s accuracy and effectiveness.

6. **Personalized Interaction**:
   - The user’s name is used to generate a personalized welcome message through the Ollama API, adding a unique interaction element to the application.
