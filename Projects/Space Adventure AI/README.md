## ðŸŽ® Project Overview

**Space Adventure AI** is more than just a game; itâ€™s an exploration of how neural networks can be applied to real-time gaming scenarios. This project was developed during the **AI Bootcamp** at **Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI)**, sponsored by **SkyElectric Pvt. Ltd.**, under the guidance of **[Sri Usama](https://www.linkedin.com/in/usamajanjua9/)**.

### Key Features:
- **AI-Controlled Gameplay**: The AI model is trained to play the game, making decisions based on the current state of the game environment.
- **Real-Time Data Collection**: Training data is collected during gameplay, allowing the AI to improve its performance over time.
- **Dynamic Obstacles**: The game features randomly generated obstacles that keep the gameplay challenging and engaging.
- **Space-Themed Visuals**: Immersive visuals with space-themed graphics and a user-friendly interface.

## ðŸ§  AI Model

The AI model is built using **TensorFlow** and consists of a simple neural network trained to control the spaceship. The model is trained on data collected during gameplay, including the position of the spaceship, speed, and distance from obstacles.

### Model Architecture:
- **Input Layer**: 8 features representing the game state.
- **Hidden Layers**: 2 Dense layers with ReLU activation.
- **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, representing the probability of performing a jump.
