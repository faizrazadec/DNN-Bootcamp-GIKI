# 🚀 Thrilled to Share My Latest Project! 🚀

I recently had the incredible opportunity to participate in an AI Bootcamp at [Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI)](https://www.giki.edu.pk/), sponsored by SkyElectric Pvt. Ltd. During this bootcamp, I worked on an exciting project where I developed a Flask application for weapon detection using the **YOLOv8n model**.

## 🔍 Project Highlights:
- **Custom-trained YOLOv8n model** on an annotated dataset for accurate weapon detection.
- Built a **Flask application** capable of detecting weapons in images, videos, and live camera feeds.
- Leveraged the power of Python libraries including **Flask, OpenCV,** and **YOLO** for seamless integration and performance.

## 💻 Dependencies Needed to Run the Project:
- **Flask**
- **OpenCV**
- **Ultralytics (YOLOv8)**

If you're interested in checking out the code or running the project yourself, you can find it on [GitHub](https://lnkd.in/d732wYqm).

This project has been a fantastic learning experience, and I'm proud of the results. A big shoutout to **Asim Shah** for the instructions and guidance throughout the project. Thank you to everyone involved in making this bootcamp a success!
